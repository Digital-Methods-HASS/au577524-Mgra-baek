Question 7:  Come up with a question you want to answer using the gapminder data and write it down. Then, create a data visualisation that answers the question and explain how your visualization answers the question.

So I totally  uncreatively want to find out how to find the life expenpancy in countries which could be used to see how
it correlates with economic growth for example.

I picked Germany - So how can we find out how the life expancy in Germany has evolved?

DE<- gapminder %>% 

filter(country=="Germany")

ggplot(DE, aes (x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country) + geom_line() +
  transition_reveal(year)
  
  This approach should be able to give us the desired results for the original question
