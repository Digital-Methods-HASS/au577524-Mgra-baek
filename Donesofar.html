Question 1: Why does it make sense to have a log10 scale on x axis?

The problem is that the two axis are very different in size by using the logarithmic scale
on the x-axis it becomes more "even" and therefore easier to look at. 

Question 2 and 4:  What country is the richest in 1952?  What are the five richest countries in the world in 2007?


subset(gapminder,year==1952) %>%       [Note you replace 1952 with 2007 in question 4]
group_by(country,gdpPercap) %>% 
summarize(min_gdpPercap=min(gdpPercap), max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap)) %>%
arrange(desc(max_gdpPercap)

By linking gdp to countries it's possible to find out what country is the most wealthy in 1952 
If I looked right it shoud be Kuwait. For 2007 it should be Norway followed by Kuwait, Singapore, The U.S and Ireland.

Question 3: Can you differentiate the continents by color and fix the axis labels?

Yes it can be done. You need to use the equal sign to put in between the two variables like color = continent
