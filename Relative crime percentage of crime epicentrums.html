# I start out with importing the required package for the operation then I define the number of cases happening in the specified districts
# The first three numbers are for Westminster 013B for the period april to june same pattern forllows for Westminster 018A and Newham 012B
# Lastly I define the cumulated number of cases for the whole period in that year. I divide the original number with 100 to shorten the script.
